??? Objective
    Research and Development of eBPF based solutions for `network-visibility and policy-enforcement`.

- Designed, developed and maintaining a portable eBPF based module with following capabilities, 
    - traces every `outgoing network-packet`
    - traces every `dns-resolution`
    - can be configured to act as `policy-based firewall` such that it,
        - `blocks dns-resolutions` not in allow-policy
        - `blocks ip-connections` not in allow-policy

- Leading the `R&D of eBPF based armour` to detect/protect agents from tampering attacks.

- Still contributing to [Harden-Runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner).

> :timer: **January-2022 to March-2022**

- Performed source‑code‑analysis of `50+ OpenSource third-Party Github Actions` for determining their GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.
    - Stored the analyzed-info in open-source [knowledge-Database](https://github.com/step-security/secure-repo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ah0x0er).

- [Raised 15+ PRs](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ah0x0er) in [Github-Actions start-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) to restrict permissions to least-privileges.
    - Resulting in `secure-by-default` starter-workflow.

- Implemented unit-tests/bug-fixes in [step-security agent](https://github.com/step-security/agent/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ah0x0er).
