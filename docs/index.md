# **About me**

I'm `Jatin Kumar`, a software engineer at [StepSecurity Inc](https://www.stepsecurity.io/), a US-based cyber security startup focusing on software-supply-chain-security.

I work primarily on CI/CD security runtime-agents that protect pipeline runners from real-world supply-chain attack similar to SolarWinds and tj-actions incidents. [ Learn more about my experiences](./experiences.md).


Outside of work, I spent time exploring new-things, reading open-source-projects or experimenting with ideas.


Reach out to me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatin-kumar-0a3755168/) or [Email](mailto://jatin.boring273@passmail.net).

Thanks !
