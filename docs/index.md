Hello :wave:.

Heartly Welcome.

I am  __Jatin Kumar__.  Currently working as `Software Engineer` [@StepSecurity Inc.](https://www.stepsecurity.io)

At StepSecurity, I spent most of my time creating, debugging & improving `Agents`.
They are EDR like softwares that are purpose built for securing CI/CD pipeline runners from `SolarWinds` like software-supply-chain attacks. [Harden-Runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) is one of the widely used open-source variant specifically developed for `Github Actions.`

When not on job, I spent time exploring, reading or experimenting.

Thanks.

!!! note
    `Unnamed Memories` is a centralized repo of my notes, logs, experiences and more.
