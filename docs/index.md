Hello :wave: !

I'm  __Jatin Kumar__.  Currently working as **Software Engineer [@StepSecurity Inc.](https://www.stepsecurity.io)**

At StepSecurity, I spent most of my time creating, debugging & improving `Agents`.
They are EDR like softwares that are purpose built for securing CI/CD pipeline runners from `SolarWinds and tj-actions` like software-supply-chain attacks. [Harden-Runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) is one of the widely used open-source variant specifically developed for `Github Actions.`

Off job, I spent time exploring new-things, reading or experimenting.

Thanks !

    `Unnamed Memories` is a centralized repo of my notes, logs, experiences and more.
