# **On AGI: Artificial General Intelligence**

## **Initial thought**

if `birds` inspired the concept of `Planes`; what about `AGI` inspired by `human-intelligence` ?

## **Questions**

- Will it behave like human-intelligence ?
- Will it be able to think about itself ?
- How interacting with it will feel like ?
- How it will interact with other AGI agents ?

## **Train of Thoughts**
